Hi I have to create a Data Labelling or Annotation web application which will be for enterprise and would be scalable using fast api and react and other related techstack.

Refer; C:\Users\abhisha3\Desktop\Projects\Perosnal\Data Annotation\PRD Docs

Complete code of Label Studio; C:\Users\abhisha3\Desktop\Projects\Perosnal\Label Studio
PRD Document by the client; C:\Users\abhisha3\Desktop\Projects\Perosnal\Data Annotation\PRD Docs\Data_Annotation_Platform_PRD_Addendum_v2.0 - Copy.pdf
Rough Proposal created by Us;
And Below detailed prompt created by me manually which should be prioritised in case of conflict.
Open Questions;C:\Users\abhisha3\Desktop\Projects\Perosnal\Data Annotation\PRD Docs\Questions.docx
Previous chat context

File Structuure; 

Follow microservice approach so that we can easily scale and add AI or LLM thing later.
Current version dont need any implementation of AI,LLM,RAG etc
Maintain below .md file or ppt ;
	Readme
	All prompt
	file structure description
	business implimentation
	New Proposal ppt
	Architecture based on prd and current project implementation
	one ppt showing figma like ui that we are going to build here.
Make required bat file now like;
	firsttimesetup
	startserver including backend and frontend
	create desktop icon which will launh project with all server running


Application;
	should follow dark theme klike netflix or n8n website
	should be having nice professional simulation effect whereever applicable.
	proper header and footer like application not website
	keep simple login approach now or implement full fledge login method using company id and create few login for admin and super admin with name abhi and share with me to login.

For Every Project I want to make a orchestration like flow having circular node.Refer attached image for this.
Circular Node representing single activity;

Normal solid filled circular node; Activity executed
Normal empty double line circule node would represent activity skipped like not needed kind of stuff whenever we dont want few task to execute here
Start Node and End Node would just set the project data, will change all stus of activity project in DB.basically this will perform all database oiperation and other configuration like notification, queue movement, email etc
Double Donut Node would represent group of node categorised under subnode like clicking on this may open three more node. Or second scenario it may be linked to other clild project being mapped to primary or parent project.like Project can have multiple Annotator so we can have several child flow defined for each annotator and then similar node to mark their progress.

One node with man sitting inside it show activity which will need manual input.like here once child project created ,it will open a manual GT which is activity with man inside it  so it will be in progress satus and annnotator will submit it once all annotation done from their side and then it will be marked completed.
We woulld foolow some color convention for all states here. like completed one light green, progress one silver etc.


we would have one table for each activty or node having unique specid showing unique node and one random generated unique id assigned to that project instance, start date, end date, last modified date,status,owner,type,eta,max eta,


We have to make multiple postgres table to store everything and we should have proper id,date attributes,joins,foreign key to related everything.

tabels can be like ;
Project table
activity table
task table
Reference table; storing statiuc data for task and activity like its uniquee id, name ,api endpoint,description
projects can have multiple profile like parent project,annotator project,review project, reassignment project etc
Each should be linked as per the business need.

I have added multiple reference image giving meaning ful name as well under C:\Users\abhisha3\Desktop\Projects\Perosnal\Data Annotation\PRD Docs

take reference and make the project in details. Work nicely with database .This should running from here only without installing external database application.As this is tghe prototype version,
Also every node should have api behind it which accept request from previous or admin panel and then do some operation and updates in db and send the request to next node.
Make proper schema for all table .

Analytics:
==========
Should have proper analytics 

task tab;
Should show list of all task and then proper filter tab in sidebar to check specific use case

Project tab;

Showing all project with all filters at roa and column level.
like one workspace number would show all project inside it.from parent project we can navigate to child by hierachy things which will list all child project and on clicking it will open that project.
